# 100+-dynamic-programs-using-J2EE (J2EE Application Development)

### All these programs are implemented using Java technologies, including JDBC, Servlets, JSP, JSTL, and various other tools and concepts. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and utilizes session tracking, Java Beans, and MySQL for database operations.

# Technologies Used
### JDBC: Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API is employed to establish a connection with the MySQL database and perform essential database operations.

### Servlets: Servlets are used to handle client requests and generate dynamic responses. They serve as the backbone of the application's backend logic.

### JSP: JavaServer Pages (JSP) is utilized for generating dynamic content on the server-side. It allows embedding Java code within HTML pages, facilitating the creation of dynamic web pages.

### JSTL: JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL) provides a set of tags for simplifying the development of JSP pages. It offers functionality like iteration, conditionals, and database operations.

### Session Tracking: Session tracking is implemented to maintain user sessions and store user-specific data across multiple requests. It ensures a personalized experience for each user.

### Java Beans: Java Beans are employed to encapsulate and manage the application's data objects. They provide an organized and modular approach to handle data.

### Model-View-Controller (MVC): The application follows the MVC architectural pattern to separate concerns and ensure code reusability. The model handles data and business logic, views handle presentation, and controllers manage the flow and interactions between them.

### MySQL: MySQL is used as the relational database management system to store and retrieve data efficiently. SQL queries are crafted to interact with the database and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
